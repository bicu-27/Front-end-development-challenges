        I am front end developer and a Messi fan!

    <p class="text">

        I've been a Messi(goat)fan for almost 10 years now. 
        In all those years, I've experienced so many joyful moments and heartbreaking ones because of him.
        I supported Barcelona because of Messi and his amazing crew, and when he moved, I followed him — supporting Argentina, PSG, and now Inter Miami, all because of him.

         The 2014 World Cup loss was one of the hardest moments for me.
          I cried like a kid who lost something precious.
         My exercise books were filled with Messi stickers, and I couldn’t stand anyone who made him angry. To me, Messi’s enemies were my enemies.        
         I've supported him through every moment, good or bad. And now, as I’m trying to become a front-end developer, 
         I decided to create this website as a tribute to Messi. 
         It’s not just a project; it’s a way to express my admiration and appreciation for everything Messi has given to football and to me as a fan.
          Messi is special — not just in this era, but in the entire history of football. No one else can earn my support the way Messi has.
